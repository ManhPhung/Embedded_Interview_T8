###VARIABLE
- A variable in C is a memory location with some name that helps store some form of data and retrieves it when required. We can store different types of data in the variable and reuse the >>>same variable for storing some other data any of times.
  
- C variable Syntax :

      data_type variable_name = value; // defining single variable
      data_type variable_name1, variable_name2; // defining mutilple variable
  
  Example :

      int a = 10; // Create a variable is a that have data type is int and value is 10.
      float b,c; // Create two variables are a and b that have data type is float and value is uninitialized.
